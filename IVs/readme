These are instrumental variables used in our study. Please reach out with questions or clarifications (thomc@chop.edu).

MR.IVs are univariable MR IVs. Nomenclature is generally Exposure.Outcome.IV.txt.gz

MVMR.IVs are for multivariable experiments. Nomenclature is generally Exposure1.Exposure2.Outcome.IV.txt.gz

In some cases we double-checked effect sizes for multivariable IVs in univariable experiments - those IVs are within MVMR.IVs but labeled *TwoSample.IV.txt.gz
